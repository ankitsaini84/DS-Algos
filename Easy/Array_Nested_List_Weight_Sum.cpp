/**
 * You are given a nested list of integers nestedList. 
 * Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.
 * 
 * The depth of an integer is the number of lists that it is inside of. 
 * For example, the nested list [1,[2,2],[[3],2],1] has each integer's value set to its depth.
 * 
 * Return the sum of each integer in nestedList multiplied by its depth.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: Four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1. 1*2 + 1*2 + 2*1 + 1*2 + 1*2 = 10.
